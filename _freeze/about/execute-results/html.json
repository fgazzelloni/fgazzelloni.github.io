Each day brings with it a fresh set of challenges to solve and opportunities for growth. It's a path marked by curiosity, resilience, and a relentless pursuit of excellence—a journey that I'm grateful to be on.\"*\n\nFederica Gazzelloni is an Actuary, and a Data Scientist with a focus on health metrics, machine learning, and data visualization. With experience spanning corporate, academic, and research roles, Federica has developed a robust skill set that bridges actuarial science, statistical modeling, and public health. \n\nFederica began her career as an actuary, working in corporate and academic settings where she focused on quantitative analysis, risk modeling, and compliance in the insurance and pensions industry. As a research-oriented actuary, she not only applied advanced actuarial principles but also developed a deep understanding of the statistical methods. Federica taught mathematics to high school students and instructed university students in computer science, helping to cultivate the next generation of data-driven professionals.\n\nIn recent years, Federica has expanded her focus to health data modeling, particularly in the context of infectious disease research. As the world faced the Covid-19 pandemic, her expertise in statistical methods and health metrics became even more relevant. Collaborating with the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), Federica contributed to global health studies that aimed to understand the spread and impact of Covid-19, as well as other pressing health issues. This experience inspired her to create a practical manual for health data analysis, which serves as a resource for professionals and students alike who wish to explore health metrics and epidemiological modeling in-depth. Her book, to be published by CRC Press, combines foundational knowledge with practical applications, including R code for real-world case studies in health metrics.\n\nFederica’s role in the pre-publication stages of GBD research enables her to directly contribute to some of the most impactful global health research being conducted today. This work not only requires technical acumen in statistical modeling but also a keen eye for detail and a commitment to accuracy, given the far-reaching implications of public health data.\n\nBeyond her work in health metrics, Federica is an active member of the open-source community, where she contributes to several organizations dedicated to education and software development. She is a Certified Carpentries Instructor, delivering workshops that empower learners with foundational data science skills in R, Python, and other tools. Federica has taught workshops for prestigious organizations, including the Helmholtz Information & Data Science Academy, the University of Washington, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), where she introduced participants to key concepts in programming, data wrangling, and statistical analysis. Her teaching style is characterized by clarity, engagement, and inclusivity, making technical content accessible to learners of all backgrounds and skill levels.\n\nFederica also serves as the Lead Organizer for R-Ladies Rome, a chapter of the global R-Ladies organization that promotes gender diversity in the R programming and data science communities. Since its founding in 2023, R-Ladies Rome has grown significantly under her leadership, reaching a large and engaged audience through online and in-person events. Through R-Ladies, Federica has organized a range of activities, from tutorials on data visualization to workshops on advanced R packages, all aimed at fostering a supportive and inclusive community for women and underrepresented groups in data science. Notable events include a session with Hadley Wickham, Chief Scientist at Posit PBC, and an upcoming workshop on building reproducible data pipelines, which reflects the group’s commitment to high-quality, practical learning opportunities.\n\nIn addition to her work with R-Ladies Rome, Federica has collaborated with other R user groups globally, including R-Ladies New York, R-Ladies Paris, and the TunisR User Group. These partnerships have expanded the reach of her initiatives, creating a more interconnected and supportive global R community. Federica is also involved with Bioconductor and the R Consortium, furthering her commitment to open-source development and collaborative learning.\n\nOne of Federica’s key strengths is her ability to use data visualization as a tool for communication and insight. Her background in data visualization allows her to create compelling visual representations of complex health data, making it easier for diverse audiences to grasp intricate statistical relationships. Whether through static graphs or interactive dashboards, Federica’s visualizations aim to tell a story, uncover trends, and empower decision-makers with actionable insights.\n\nThroughout her career, Federica has consistently demonstrated a commitment to knowledge sharing and community building. Her work is informed by a belief in the power of data to drive positive change, especially in fields like public health where informed decision-making can save lives. Her contributions to education, open-source software, and health metrics research underscore her dedication to making data science an inclusive and impactful field.\n\n\n\n## Book\n\n### Health Metrics and the Spread of Infectious Diseases: Machine Learning Applications and Spatial Modelling Analysis with R\n\nDiscover the fascinating world of health metrics and infectious disease analysis with our manual! \n\nWhether you're new to the field or a seasoned practitioner, this resource offers valuable insights into key concepts and practical applications.\n\n:::::{.callout}\n\n::::{.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n\nRead it online for free: \n\n- 👉 🔗 [hmsidR](https://fgazzelloni.github.io/hmsidR/)\n\nReserve your paperback copy: \n\n- 👉 🔗[Routledge Website](https://www.routledge.com/Health-Metrics-and-the-Spread-of-Infectious-Diseases-Machine-Learning-Applications-and--Spatial-Modelling-Analysis-with-R/Gazzelloni/p/book/9781032625782)\n- 👉 🔗[Amazon](https://amzn.to/4aHGseT)\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n\n![Editor CRC Press - Chapman & Hall](images/book_cover.png){width=\"50%\" height=\"auto\"}\n:::\n::::\n\n:::::\n\\\n\nLearn about essential public health metrics like **DALYs**, **YLL**, and **YLD**, which provide crucial indicators of a population's health status.
