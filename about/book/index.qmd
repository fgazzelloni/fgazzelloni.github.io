Learn about essential public health metrics like **DALYs**, **YLL**, and **YLD**, which provide crucial indicators of a population's health status. Dive into recent infectious disease outbreaks, including the impact of Covid19, and explore the most affected locations.

With a mix of explanatory text and hands-on R code examples, you'll become proficient in analyzing real-world case studies. We'll compare health metrics across different locations and test predictive models using `tidymodels` and `INLA.` Plus, you'll discover the power of spatial visualization techniques using `ggplot2`, `leaflet`, `sf`, `rgdal`, and other popular R packages. Whether you're a beginner or an advanced practitioner, this book is designed to enhance your understanding and skills in health data analysis.

Ideal for early-stage practitioners and graduate students in public health, this resource is your guide to unlocking the full potential of R for spatial and health metrics analysis.
